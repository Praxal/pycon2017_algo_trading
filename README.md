This GitHub repository is created for proposal of my talk at PyCon India 2017 - 
### Introduction to Algorithmic Trading at Indian Stock Markets using Python

(It hasn't been announed yet if this talk is selected)

------------------------------

**For what audience is this talk intended?**

For those interested in using the power of Python to book profits and save time by automating their trading strategies at Indian Stock Markets.

**What is Algorithmic Trading?**

Imagine if you can write a Python script which can, for example, *automatically BUY 100 shares of company 'X' when its price hits 52 week low and SELL it when its price hits 52 week high* or based on some other different strategy which suits you. Sounds cool, right? 

Algorithmic Trading is the process of using computer programs, based on a predefined algorithm, for placing a trade in order to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.

*(The above example is very basic. You can code very complex strategies!)*

**Tell me the advantages of Algorithmic Trading over Conventional Trading**

*Here are a few reasons why algorithmic trading can lead to high chances of success -*


 - Ability to take into account large number of factors for decision making, which can be practically impossible for a human
 - Trades can be timed correctly. Manually placing trade involves delay which may result in significant price change by the time trade is placed
 - Human error eliminated while placing trades

And lastly, you can use your precious time for something else! Just let your computer monitor the stock markets 24x7 and place trade orders for you.

----------


**Ok. Now that you have got me interested, tell me quickly what this TALK will cover.**

For implementing Algorithmic Trading in Python, you need the following -

 - Ability to query current price of a stock in Python
 - Ability to query historical price of a stock in Python
 - Ability to place BUY/SELL trade order at Indian Stock Exchanges (NSE/BSE) using Python
 - A strategy (ie the *Algorithm*), which based on current price and historic data gives out predictions whether to BUY, SELL or HOLD.

**This TALK will demonstrate a simple yet working trading strategy along with backtesting, in Python, covering all the above points.**

*Please note, I have put the target audience as "Beginners" and hence keeping it simple. I agree there is a lot more that can be done in this space.*
